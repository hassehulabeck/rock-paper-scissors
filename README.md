# Rock-paper-scissors

A very simple version of the classic game. Needed to freshen up the es modules, and this fitted well.

## Play

Just three buttons. The cpu just gets random choises.

Download and run `index.html` through live server or something similar (can't be run by open file in browser, as it has modules.)
